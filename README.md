# hello-world
Hi, people,
My name is Peter Parkin and I like coding stuff in C++, especially if it involves low-level hardware, custom memory allocators and multi-theading things.
I work primarily in Windows, but should probably get around to some kind of Unix (although I hear you don't get IoCompletionPorts or wait for multiple objects)
